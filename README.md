# Airplane-Fare-Prediction-using-ML
Here we are trying to minimize the fare price of the flights by using various machine learning techniques. We even made many plots using
plotly, cufflinks, boxplot to minimize the outliers in the data. The dataset consists of more than 8000 entries of different flights following a
different route and at different intervals of time. I even performed target guided encoding on the data to deal with categorical data. Importance
of each and every different feature is also being used using mutual info regression to consider only the important features that are
responsible for affecting the fare prices. I made use of random forest regressor on the model and got an accuracy for about 95%.
